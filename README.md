Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a machine learning enthusiast who is passionate about using technology to make the world a better place. As a lifelong learner, I'm constantly seeking new knowledge and skills to help me create meaningful solutions that positively impact society.

In particular, I'm interested in using machine learning to address social and environmental issues. I believe that this powerful technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach complex problems and create a more sustainable and equitable future for all.

When I'm not coding, you can find me cycling through the city streets, enjoying the fresh air and freedom that comes with two wheels. I believe that bicycles are not only a great way to stay active and reduce our carbon footprint, but also a powerful symbol of community and connection.

I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate on projects that align with my values and goals. If you're interested in working together, please don't hesitate to reach out!

Thank you for visiting my profile and I look forward to connecting with you soon.
